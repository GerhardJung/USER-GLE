/* ERROR/WARNING messages:

E: Illegal ... command

Self-explanatory.  Check the input script syntax and compare to the
documentation for the command.  You can use -echo screen as a
command-line option when running LAMMPS to see the offending line.

E: Cannot open fix ave/correlate file %s

The specified file cannot be opened.  Check that the path and name are
correct.

E: Compute ID for fix ave/correlate does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate compute does not calculate a scalar

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate compute does not calculate a vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate compute vector is accessed out-of-range

The index for the vector is out of bounds.

E: Fix ID for fix ave/correlate does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate fix does not calculate a scalar

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate fix does not calculate a vector

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate fix vector is accessed out-of-range

The index for the vector is out of bounds.

E: Fix for fix ave/correlate not computed at compatible time

Fixes generate their values on specific timesteps.  Fix ave/correlate
is requesting a value on a non-allowed timestep.

E: Variable name for fix ave/correlate does not exist

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate variable is not equal-style variable

Self-explanatory.

E: Fix ave/correlate missed timestep

You cannot reset the timestep to a value beyond where the fix
expects to next perform averaging.
